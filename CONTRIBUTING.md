# Contributing

## Steps

Follow the steps bellow to add a new feature, make an improvement or fix a bug.
(Make sure to read the guides on each step as they contain important additional information)

- Make sure your development environment meets the [prerequisites](./docs/Prerequisites.md)
- [Install](./docs/Installation.md) the project on your machine
- Open a branch if you have permission, else [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository and [make your changes](./docs/MakingChanges.md)
- [Check your](./docs/CodeQuality.md) code locally
- Submit a [Pull Request](./docs/PullRequests.md) for validation
- [Merge and publish](./docs/PullRequests.md) your contribution

## External contributors

Our contribution process is currently focused on internal contributions (Natura developers from other teams).
We currently depend on our pipeline (that works only on branches) for the review process and the jira issue number for pre-releases.
We intend to have a well defined external contribution process and docs in the future!

In the meantime, if you want to make a contribution, please [open an issue](https://github.com/natura-cosmeticos/natds-rn/issues).
